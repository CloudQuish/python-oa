    Question 6: Bank Account Class (5 points)
    
    Create a BankAccount class with the following features:
    - Initialize with account_number and initial_balance (default 0)

    - withdraw(amount) method that subtracts money if sufficient balance
    - get_balance() method that returns current balance
    - All amounts should be positive numbers
